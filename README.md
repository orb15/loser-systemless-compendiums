# Loser Systemless Compeniums
A Systemless module for Foundry VTT.

This module implements a "Compendium/Content" module for Foundry Virtual Table Top (ref: https://foundryvtt.com/).

The compendiums provided in this module target the Systemless game system (ref: https://github.com/orb15/systemless).
The Systemless system allows GM's and players to play any game system.
You cannot make use of this content without also using the Systemless system.

The content in these compendiums is for the Loser OSE game.
Loser is a modified version of the Old School Essentials game system (ref: https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Main_Page).
The Loser rules are hosted here: https://industrialpotato.net/index.php/OSR/OSEHouseRules.

# Changelog
The latest production version is listed at the top of the table.
Older versions are listed below the top row.
Note that Foundry Virtual Table Top (FVTT) often makes breaking changes between major versions (FVTT v9 -> v10 significantly changed the internal Data Model, for example) that necessitate some type of rework in this code.
Given this, this code is not strictly backward compatible to older versions of FVTT.
That is, a version of this system that has been tested to work on FVTT v9 will (possibly/probably) not work on FVTT v10.
In general, you should use the tagged version of this software compatible with the version of FVTT you are running.

## Major and Minor Versions
Major version changes in the table below do _not_ mean that this software itself is undergoing a breaking change.
Systemless will update it's major version when FVTT makes a major revision (going from FVTT v9 -> v10 for example).

Minor version changes are used to add new features to a major version.
Minor version updates will never contain breaking changes of any kind.

Patch version changes are to address defects or perform chores within a minor version.


## Changelog Updates
This Changelog wil be updated with each version change.
This Changelog will be periodically updated to reflect the latest version of FVTT on which the Systemless system has been tested.
